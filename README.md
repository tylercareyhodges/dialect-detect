# UK Accent Identification

Machine learning models for analyzing speech and distinguishing between UK dialects and accents.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview
This repository explores **automatic accent and dialect recognition** in English varieties spoken across the UK.  
We focus on building models that can classify audio samples into broad dialect groups, such as:

- Northern English  
- Southern English  
- Midlands English  
- Scottish English  
- Welsh English  
- Irish English  

The project leverages open datasets (e.g., [Common Voice](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/), [Accents of the British Isles](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2022S04), [Speech Accent Archive](https://accent.gmu.edu/)) and modern deep learning models like **Wav2Vec2** and **XLS-R**.
